# CancunHotel
 
- The API was created with .NET 5 in Visual Studio for macOS.
- The repository does not have the .gitignore file, so you may encounter assembly files.
- The code has the business validations, I did not include validations of null and unspecified fields.
- I allowed reservations to be created on the same day of the system.
- The api has the Swagger configured to show the available APIs.
- I did not add a log option, but specified a comment where I thought it might be needed.
